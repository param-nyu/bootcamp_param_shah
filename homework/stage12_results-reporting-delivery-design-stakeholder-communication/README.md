# Scenario Analysis Final Report

## Overview
This project presents a **Scenario Analysis Dashboard** comparing three scenarios â€” **Baseline**, **Alt-Impute**, and **Alt-Outlier** â€” to evaluate **returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio)**. The purpose of this analysis was to examine how different data handling approaches (imputation methods, outlier adjustments) affect portfolio performance and decision-making.

---

## Final Deliverable
- Initially, the goal was to deploy an **interactive Streamlit app** with Seaborn visualizations.  
- Due to deployment constraints, the Streamlit app **could not be deployed online**.  
- Instead, the **final report** is delivered as a **locally generated `Streamlit Webpage.pdf`** capturing all plots, insights, and analyses.  
- A professional Markdown version was also created within Streamlit to summarize the results in a report-like format.

## Contents of the Final Report
1. **Executive Summary** â€“ Key insights across all scenarios, highlighting returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios.  
2. **Visual Analysis** â€“  
   - Bar chart for scenario returns  
   - Scatter plot for risk-return tradeoff with Sharpe ratio sizing  
   - Line chart showing metric trends over time  
3. **Assumptions & Risks** â€“ Explanation of methodology assumptions per scenario and potential data risks.  
4. **Sensitivity Analysis** â€“ Comparison of each scenario against the baseline.  
5. **Decision Implications** â€“ Recommendations based on scenario performance and risk considerations.

> ðŸ’¡ The report was prepared to be **readable and presentable as a PDF**, ensuring that the final deliverable reflects all analyses even without live deployment.
